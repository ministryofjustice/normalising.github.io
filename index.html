                <p class="govuk-body">Interacting with any part of the justice system is not always pleasant if it's the
                    result of a
                    negative experience, which is why we aim to make it as easy and painless as possible. We do this
                    through the principles of user-centred design and we know that we cannot be truly user-centred
                    unless the people in our teams represent the people we build services for.</p>

                <p class="govuk-body">We’ve been collecting data on our demographics to understand how representative we
                    are and where we
                    need to focus our efforts to improve. Here we share with you the latest data showing, where
                    possible, a comparison between our team and the UK population. We commit to updating this data on an
                    annual basis and will use it to hold ourselves accountable and ensure we’re constantly reviewing our
                    actions to keep doing better.</p>

                <p class="govuk-body">It’s not just about numbers for us though. As acclaimed diversity activist Vernā
                    Myers puts it:
                    "Diversity is being invited to the party. Inclusion is being asked to dance®". We have a network of
                    champions working on activities and events throughout the year to ensure our team members feel
                    included, engaged and valued, and we measure their success through fortnightly pulse surveys and the
                    annual Civil Service People Survey. You can read more about some of those initiatives towards the
                    bottom of this page and in our diversity and inclusion blog posts.</p>

                            Our numbers are much better than the average among the tech industry, which has remained at
                            around 16% since 2009, but we still have work to do.

                            However, we do not have data on the ethnic diversity of our senior management as the numbers
                            are too low, and although representation looks good, the declaration rate was only 74% and
                            4% chose to answer ‘prefer not to say’. This suggests we have some work to do to encourage
                            people to feel safe sharing their ethnicity.

                            up conversations to try to change that.</p>

                <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What have we done?</h2>

                <p class="govuk-body">
                    Loads! Here are a few examples:
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Champions:</strong> We have a network of champions who meet regularly to review our
                    demographic data and work together to deliver initiatives to improve representation and inclusion.
                </p>

                <p class="govuk-body">
                    <strong>Inclusive recruitment:</strong> We’ve reduced the essential criteria on our job descriptions
                    and run them through a gender decoder to ensure the language we use isn’t putting people off
                    applying. We ask candidates to remove their names from their CVs and ensure all our interview panels
                    are gender-diverse and ethnically diverse.
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    <strong>Spreading the word:</strong> We’ve hosted and presented at events aimed at women and
                    diversity in tech to spread awareness of our job opportunities and benefits.
                </p>

                <p class="govuk-body">
                    <strong>Partnerships and apprenticeships:</strong>
                </p>

                <p class="govuk-body">
                    <strong>LGBTQ* inclusion:</strong> We have a strong LGBTQ* community, which contributed to the MOJ
                    rising from 204th (in 2016) to 5th in Stonewall’s most recent Top Employers list.
                </p>

                <p class="govuk-body">
                    <strong>Fair and open pay:</strong> We have standard pay scales based on the level of responsibility
                    of each role and we publish these openly with our job adverts. We have also been working to align
                    our existing team members’ pay with the Digital Data and Technology Pay Framework set up by the
                    Government Digital Service, which allows for specific pay increases based on performance. We hope
                    this will help to reduce any pay inequities including our gender pay gap.
                </p>

                <p class="govuk-body">
                    <strong>Flexible working:</strong> All of our roles have several options for flexible working,
                    including working part time, job shares, or working remotely. At the moment most of us are working
                    from home full time but even when there’s not a global pandemic we have the opportunity to choose
                    how often we go into the office and set working days and hours that fit around the rest of our
                    lives.
                </p>

                <p class="govuk-body">
                    <strong>Equipment:</strong> Everyone can request equipment for use in the office or at home to make
                    their workspace more comfortable and suited to their needs, including assistive technology and
                    ergonomic chairs.
                </p>

                <p class="govuk-body">
                    <strong>Inclusive benefits:</strong> We offer an array of inclusive benefits as standard across the
                    Civil Service including generous (shared) parental leave, paid sick leave, bereavement and special
                    leave, and access for all staff to an Employee Assistance Programme that includes a 24 hour phone
                    line with occupational therapists and the ability to self refer for counselling sessions.

                <p class="govuk-body">
                    Digging into the data: We’re trying to source data on areas such as socio-economic background and
                    parenting or caring responsibilities, to give us greater understanding of our team’s make-up and
                    needs. We’re also working on getting data by profession as we suspect that representation may be
                    worse in some than others. For example we believe that we have fewer women in more technical roles,
                    such as software development, technical architecture and cyber security. Knowing which professions
                    are least representative will help us to focus our efforts to attract and support minoritised people
                    to join us.
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    <strong>Intersectionality:</strong> We’re working on getting intersectional data as many people will
                    fall into more than one underrepresented group and we want to make sure we’re not only hiring - for
                    example - straight, white, cis women, and that we’re considering the compounded effects of battling
                    multiple biases.
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    <strong>Job advertising:</strong> We’re working with organisations leading on diversity in tech to
                    advertise our roles to their communities and promote the many benefits of working with us to a
                    wider, more diverse network.

                <p class="govuk-body">
                    <strong>Developing training:</strong> We want everyone in the team to appreciate how important
                    diversity and inclusion are and know how they can contribute to our efforts to improve. We’re
                    developing training to help us do that.
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    <strong>Mental health support:</strong> We’ve started running regular online sessions with the NHS
                    on various mental health topics to give extra support to our team members throughout lockdown and
                    the pandemic.
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    <strong>Seeking inspiration:</strong> We’re organising regular online lightning talks from prominent
                    women in the industry to share their experiences and expertise with our team members. We plan to
                    widen this to include representatives from other minoritised groups.
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    <strong>Listening and learning:</strong> We’ll continue listening to our team members and reviewing
                    their feedback to make sure we keep improving. We’ll also be setting up sessions with experts on
                    different areas of diversity, equity and inclusion so we can learn from them.

                <p class="govuk-body">
                    We ask our team members to answer demographic questions via the MOJ online HR system. This is
                    accessible by permanent staff, who make up 75% of our team (817 people). The data is then processed
                    by data experts and shared with us anonymously with responses below five suppressed to ensure
                    individuals cannot be identified.
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    We receive this data every three months to analyse and act on but the latest we can share publicly
                    is from March 2019, in line with the most recent public data shared on the MOJ as a department. Once
                    that is updated we will update this page too.
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    The data we have currently only covers a handful of areas and does not allow for intersectional
                    analysis - we’re working on this so that we can get a fuller picture of our team make-up and ensure
                    that everyone feels respected and celebrated for all of their characteristics.
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    The gender pay gap data is collected from HR data and shared with us anonymously. It is just for
                    permanent team members, it doesn’t include contractors or agency staff. The latest publicly
                    shareable data is from March 2020 but we do have more recent data internally that we’re reviewing
                    and acting on.
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    We’re using data from the 2011 UK census as a framework for comparison because it’s the closest we
                    can get to an estimate of our user base and recruitment pool. Once the 2021 census data is released
                    we’ll use that.
